1. Is memory aligned? no issues
2. Is heap memory implemented? implemented in malloc
3. 32MB of memory starting from 0x8000000 ->  0xa000000
4. the small memory may be an issue if rust generates code that is too large 
in cargo.toml dependencies

6. Remove file.c call and include a header


1. file.c links <stdlib.h>, which includes malloc and free. I can try to link 
<stdlib.h> to get malloc/free, or I can use a Rust crate. malloc/free contain syscalls,
such as sbrk, however a lot of the code is a just a library call that doesn't 
require a syscall, but we have sbrk implemented in kernel space when malloc and free
need it. In fact, I think in Linux, malloc and free come from libc, but the Linux kernel 
itself implements the syscalls.
